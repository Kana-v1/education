Volt - V (sometimes E)
Current - I. 1 amp = 1 coulob of charge per second

Power(watts): P = V * I

R = V / I

parallel resistance: R = 1 / (1 / R1 + 1 / R2)

conductance: G = 1 / R

dissipated power: P = I * V

transfer function H = output voltate / input voltage

voltage source has to maintain a fixed voltage drop across its terminals

current source has to maintain a constant current through the external circuit

an open circuit has connected to it
a short circuit is a piece of wire bridging the output

If you wanna attach source loader to the circuit, loader's has to be much bigger  than the circuit's resistance
